# Initial Configurations

As mentioned in the purpose, all the works are done by prompting, at least as much as possible.
But I am not going to list all the prompts here, rather record the process and setbacks.

## Project Init

Starting from Windsurf, tell Cascade to setup a personal blog website using Hugo.
I checked all the commands suggested by the AI, but never reject them since they are harmless.

After a while, the project is initialized.

### Theme Issue

At the beginning, I asked for a `modern and fancy theme`.
I got three suggestions, and I went with `Toha`, however it looks like there was some compatibility issue with Hugo setup.
AI tried several rounds to solve it, but failed.
I then asked for a `modern and simple theme` again, and got `PaperMod`.
It worked.
I will explore the theme in detail later.

### MCP

MCP is great, but my curret license with Windsurf doesn't support it.
So I decided to use MCP with `Cline` extension.

For most of the local running commands, Windsurf Cascade is sufficient.
I mainly use MCP for GitHub and Cloudflare.

GitHub MCP works out of box, but Cloudflare MCP has some bugs, which is the same as this issue: https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/issues/12

I will try to fix it later.

## Cloudflare

Since the Cloudflare MCP has some bugs, I operated manually with Cloudflare Pages in the web browser.

Only issue was the version of Hugo at Cloudflare Pages was too low, and I just need to add an environment variable to fix it.

## Future Posts Generations

I will use Windsurf Cascade to generate the posts, my idea is to keep the drafts in some markdown files, and use Windsurf Cascade to generate the posts.

## Summary

This is a fun journey to experience the capabilities of AI-powered development tools.
