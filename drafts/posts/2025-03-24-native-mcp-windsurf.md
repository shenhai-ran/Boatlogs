# Native MCP Integration in Windsurf Editor

- very good news, I have MCP running natively in Windsurf Editor, so no `Cline` extension needed.
- migiration is really easy, just copy the json file from `Cline` extension to `Windsurf`.
- again, cloudflare MCP doesn't work, it shows error as **here insert image at here "C:\Users\<xxx >\Downloads\Screenshot 2025-03-24 094614.png"**, don't know if it is tool issue or my license related.
- a remark: it looks like I don't have web search for Cascade yet, so some information may not be completely correct to the lastest. I will figure out later.
