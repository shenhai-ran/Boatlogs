# Lessons Learned

This is a draft for a blog post about lessons learned while building this blog with AI assistance. This post will cover:

## Misunderstandings of Abbreviations

This is not a new lesson but I still forget about it.
It is not a good idea to use abbreviation in the content of the prompts, because the AI may not understand what you mean.
In the last post, **add a link here to the last post**, I used MCP, which should be Model Context Protocol, but AI interpreted it as something else.

I won't change it, since it is what had happened.

## Implications

I used the name `Boat/-Logs` for this blog, but I don't mean it is about boats or sailing.
I just like the name.
But AI interpreted it as so, and used lots of boats and sailing related words in the posts, which I explicitly forbid it in the rules.

## Local Rules

Windsurf Cascade has a local rules file, which is `./.windsurfrules`.
I will use it to define the rules for the posts generation.

**Here please add all the contents of the local rules file as a code block**

The local rules will be updated as I go, but will not update the posts that have already been generated.

## Summary

**Here please add the summary of the lessons learned**
