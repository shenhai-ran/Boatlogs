This post is generated by AI based on the draft file [2025-04-08-example-of-mcp-part-1.md](https://github.com/shenhai-ran/Boatlogs/blob/main/drafts/posts/2025-04-08-example-of-mcp-part-1.md). It explores my journey with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and discusses some of the challenges I've encountered.

## Example of MCP, Part 1

It has been a while since my last post, because I have been playing around with different MCP tools. This will be the first post of a series about MCP.

## MCP in a Nutshell

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework designed to extend AI language models with specialized tools or capabilities. Introduced by Anthropic, MCP allows models to call external APIs or services to complete tasks they couldn't do on their own, such as accessing real-time information, performing calculations, or interacting with external systems.

At its core, MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to communicate with external tools, making them more capable and useful for complex tasks. The protocol enables a two-way conversation: the model can request specific information or actions, and the tool can provide responses that the model then incorporates into its reasoning.

Rather than requiring models to be retrained with specialized knowledge, MCP provides a plug-and-play approach where new capabilities can be added through external connections. This makes AI systems more flexible, powerful, and able to adapt to new use cases without fundamental changes to the underlying model.

## MCP in Action

Here are five MCP servers I have been using:

### 1. GitHub MCP Server

[GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github)

The GitHub MCP server provides AI assistants with the ability to interact directly with GitHub repositories and services. This server enables numerous GitHub-related operations including:

- Repository management (creating, forking, cloning)
- File operations (viewing, creating, updating files)
- Issue tracking (creating, commenting, updating issues)
- Pull request handling (creating, reviewing, merging PRs)
- Search capabilities across GitHub (code, repositories, issues)

This MCP server is particularly valuable for development workflows, allowing AI assistants to help with code reviews, repository organization, and collaborative coding tasks without requiring separate API integrations.

### 2. Google Maps MCP Server

[Google Maps MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/google-maps)

The Google Maps MCP server provides AI assistants with access to Google Maps Platform services. Key features include:

- Geocoding and reverse geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates and vice versa)
- Directions between locations with various transportation modes
- Distance and travel time calculations
- Place search and details retrieval
- Elevation data for geographical points

This server enables location-aware capabilities for AI assistants, allowing them to answer questions about places, provide directions, and incorporate geographical context into their responses.

### 3. Playwright MCP Server

[Playwright MCP Server](https://github.com/Automata-Labs-team/MCP-Server-Playwright)

The Playwright MCP server, developed by Automata Labs, enables AI assistants to control web browsers programmatically. This allows for:

- Web automation and testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- Screenshot capture and visual verification
- Form filling and user interaction simulation
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Network request monitoring and modification

This MCP server is particularly useful for tasks involving web interaction, allowing AI assistants to help with testing workflows, data collection, and automated browsing tasks.

### 4. Cloudflare MCP Server

[Cloudflare MCP Server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)

The Cloudflare MCP server provides AI assistants with access to Cloudflare's suite of services, including:

- Workers management (deployment, updating, and debugging serverless functions)
- DNS configuration and management
- Website performance and analytics data
- Security settings and firewall rules
- Content delivery network (CDN) configuration

This server is valuable for developers and system administrators who use Cloudflare's infrastructure, allowing AI assistants to help manage web properties, optimize performance, and implement security policies.

### 5. Fetch MCP Server

[Fetch MCP Server](https://github.com/zcaceres/fetch-mcp)

The Fetch MCP server provides AI assistants with the ability to retrieve content from external web sources. Core capabilities include:

- Fetching HTML content from websites
- Converting web content to markdown for easier processing
- Retrieving JSON data from APIs
- Extracting plain text from web resources
- Making HTTP requests with custom headers

This server enables AI assistants to access real-time information from the web, incorporating external data into their responses without needing direct internet access.

## Issues with MCP

### Too Many Tools from MCP

For Cloudflare and Playwright MCP, I have encountered some issues saying: "adding this instance would exceed max allowed tools" from Windsurf. I believe this limitation is imposed by Windsurf itself, though this needs confirmation.

The problem likely stems from the fact that each MCP server exposes multiple tool functions, and there may be a cap on the total number of tools that can be loaded simultaneously. This creates challenges when trying to use multiple complex MCP servers together, forcing choices about which capabilities to prioritize.

### Network Connection

I've noticed that MCP servers are mostly developed using either Node.js or Python. In the Python case, they often use `uvx` to run the server. However, when operating within a network with proxies or self-signed certificates, network connection issues can arise, as I experienced with the fetch MCP from the official repositories.

These connectivity problems represent a limitation of the current MCP implementation without robust configuration options for complex network environments. The servers generally assume straightforward internet access, which isn't always available in corporate or secured environments.

I hope these limitations will be addressed in future iterations of the MCP ecosystem, providing more flexible configuration options and better handling of enterprise network requirements.

## Looking Forward

Despite these challenges, I'm excited about the potential of MCP to extend AI capabilities in meaningful ways. In future posts, I'll explore specific use cases and share more detailed experiences with individual MCP servers.

The ability to give AI models access to external tools is transformative, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this ecosystem evolves. Stay tuned for more posts in this series as I continue experimenting with different MCP implementations!
