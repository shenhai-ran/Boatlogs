# Welcome to Boat • logs

Hello and welcome to **Boat • logs**, a site that demonstrates the capabilities of AI-powered development tools. This entire website was created using only prompts to AI systems within the Windsurf editor and MCP servers from Cline extensions.

## Purpose of This Website

The primary purpose of this website is to:

1. **Test AI Functions in Windsurf Editor** - Exploring how effectively an AI assistant can help build and maintain a complete website
2. **Experiment with MCP Servers** - Testing the Model Context Protocol servers from Cline extensions
3. **Prompt-Only Development** - Creating a complete website setup with minimal direct coding
4. **Document the AI Development Journey** - Tracking what works well and what challenges arise

## The Technical Stack

After researching options with AI assistance, I decided on:

- **Hugo Framework** - For its speed, simplicity, and extensive theme ecosystem
- **Cloudflare Pages** - For reliable, fast hosting with seamless deployment
- **PaperMod Theme** - A clean, modern Hugo theme that works well with our setup

What makes this project interesting is that every aspect—from initial setup to theme selection, configuration, and content creation—is being driven through AI prompts rather than traditional manual development.

## What You'll Find Here

In this blog, I'll document:

- The process of setting up this website entirely through AI prompts
- Successes and challenges in AI-assisted development
- Tips and tricks discovered along the way
- Thoughts on the effectiveness of current AI tools for web development

I'll also be creating the first few posts solely through prompts to see how far we can push these AI capabilities.

## The Name "Boat • logs"

The name has a dual meaning:
- Traditional ship's logs that record a journey
- The "logs" produced when testing AI systems and documenting the results

Thank you for visiting this experimental project. I look forward to sharing insights from this AI-driven development journey.
