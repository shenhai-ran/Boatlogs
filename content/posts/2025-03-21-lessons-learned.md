description: "Insights and lessons learned from building a blog with AI assistance"
---

This post is generated by AI based on the draft file [2025-03-21-lessons-learned.md](https://github.com/shenhai-ran/Boatlogs/blob/main/drafts/posts/2025-03-21-lessons-learned.md). It captures some important lessons I've learned while building this blog with AI assistance.

## Misunderstandings of Abbreviations

This is not a new lesson but I still forget about it.

It is not a good idea to use abbreviations in the content of prompts, because AI may not understand what you mean. In the last post, [Getting Started: Initial Configurations of Boat/-Logs](../2025-03-20-getting-started-initial-configurations/), I used MCP, which should be Model Context Protocol, but AI interpreted it as something else.

I won't change it, since it is what had happened. This highlights an important point when working with AI: clarity matters tremendously. Using industry-specific or technical abbreviations without explanation can lead to misinterpretations, as AI systems may not have the exact same contextual understanding that humans in a specific field might have.

## Implications of Naming

I used the name `Boat/-Logs` for this blog, but I don't mean it to be about boats or sailing. I just like the name. But the AI interpreted it as such and used many boat and sailing-related words in the posts, which I explicitly forbid in the rules.

This taught me an important lesson about naming and AI: names carry strong semantic associations for AI models. When you choose a name that has strong associations with a particular domain (like "Boat/-Logs" with sailing), you need to be very explicit about overriding those associations if that's not your intent.

Even though I added a rule explicitly forbidding sailing terminology, the thematic pull of the name was strong enough that the AI still gravitated toward nautical metaphors. This is a fascinating example of how AI models work with semantic associations, and how difficult it can be to override strong connections in their training data.

## Local Rules

Windsurf Cascade has a local rules file, which is `./.windsurfrules`. I've been using it to define the rules for post generation. This has been extremely helpful in maintaining consistency across posts while allowing for flexibility as the project evolves.

Here are the contents of the local rules file:

```markdown
This is a repository of a personal blog website.
The purpose of the blog is to experience the capabilities of AI-powered development tools, particularly Windsurf editor and MCP servers from Cline extensions.

## The Technical Stack

After researching options with AI assistance, I decided on:

- **Hugo Framework** - For its speed, simplicity, and extensive theme ecosystem
- **Cloudflare Pages** - For reliable, fast hosting with seamless deployment
- **PaperMod Theme** - A clean, modern Hugo theme that works well with our setup
- **GitHub** - For version control and code management, user: shenhai-ran, repo: Boatlogs

What makes this project interesting is that every aspect—from initial setup to theme selection, configuration, and content creation—is being driven through AI prompts rather than traditional manual development.

## Posts Generation Rules

- The ideas and high-level structure of the posts are written in markdown files.
- The location of the markdown files is `./drafts/posts/`.
- The markdown files are named in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-titl.md`.
- You are responsible for generating the content of the posts. 
- When generating the posts, combine the information from the markdown files with tasks you have done.
- All posts generated by AI should have the tag `AI Generated`.
- If you are going to reference any makrdown draft file, add a hyper link to the corresponding file in GitHub. Figure out the link from the file path.
- Elaborate on the tasks you have done in the posts and make the post fun to read.
- Even though the name is `Boatlogs`, the content of the posts is not about boats or sailing, so do not use any terminologies related to boats or sailing.
- For each generated post, you should say at the beginning that this post is generated by AI, and based on the which draft file. Add a hyper link to the corresponding file in GitHub. Figure out the link from the file path.
- Import instructions in the context is higlighted with **<instructions>**, ensure following them.
```

The local rules will be updated as I go, but they won't update posts that have already been generated. This creates an interesting record of how the blog and its guidelines evolve over time.

Working with local rules has made me appreciate how much AI-assisted writing benefits from clear, consistent guidelines. Rather than having to repeat the same instructions each time, I can centralize them and focus on the unique aspects of each post.

## Working with AI-Specific Markup

I've learned that adding specific markup for AI instructions makes a significant difference in getting consistent results. For example, in my rules I now include the instruction:

> Import instructions in the context is highlighted with **\<instructions\>**, ensure following them.

This kind of explicit markup creates clear signals for the AI about what parts of the text are instructions versus content. I've found this particularly useful when I want to include placeholder text or sections that need special attention.

## Summary

The lessons I've learned so far in this AI-assisted blog development journey include:

1. **Be explicit and avoid abbreviations**: When working with AI, clarity trumps brevity. Spell things out rather than using abbreviations or industry jargon.

2. **Names carry strong associations**: Choose project names carefully, as they create strong semantic connections for AI models that can be difficult to override.

3. **Consistent rules improve outcomes**: Creating a centralized set of rules makes working with AI much more efficient and leads to more consistent results.

4. **Special markup helps with instructions**: Using designated markup for instructions helps the AI distinguish between content and guidance.

5. **AI needs explicit overrides**: When you want AI to behave counter to its usual patterns (like avoiding nautical terms for a project called "Boatlogs"), you need to be extremely clear and explicit about those overrides.

These insights will help refine my approach to AI-assisted development as this blog project continues to evolve. The interplay between human guidance and AI capabilities creates an interesting collaborative dynamic that I'm continuing to explore.
