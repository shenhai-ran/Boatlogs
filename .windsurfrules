This is a repository of a personal blog website with the name `Boat/-Logs`.
The purpose of the blog is to experience the capabilities of AI-powered development tools, particularly Windsurf editor and MCP servers from Cline extensions.

## The Technical Stack

After researching options with AI assistance, I decided on:

- **Hugo Framework** - For its speed, simplicity, and extensive theme ecosystem
- **Cloudflare Pages** - For reliable, fast hosting with seamless deployment
- **PaperMod Theme** - A clean, modern Hugo theme that works well with our setup
- **GitHub** - For version control and code management, user: shenhai-ran, repo: Boatlogs

What makes this project interesting is that every aspect—from initial setup to theme selection, configuration, and content creation—is being driven through AI prompts rather than traditional manual development.

## Posts Generation Rules

- The ideas and high-level structure of the posts are written in markdown files.
- The location of the markdown files is `./drafts/posts/`.
- The markdown files are named in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-titl.md`.
- You are responsible for generating the content of the posts. 
- When generating the posts, combine the information from the markdown files with tasks you have done.
- All posts generated by AI should have the tag `AI Generated`.
- If you are going to reference any makrdown draft file, add a hyper link to the corresponding file in GitHub. Figure out the link from the file path.
- Elaborate on the tasks you have done in the posts and make the post fun to read.
- Even though the name is `Boatlogs`, the content of the posts is not about boats or sailing, so do not use any terminologies related to boats or sailing.
- For each generated post, you should say at the beginning that this post is generated by AI, and based on the which draft file. Add a hyper link to the corresponding file in GitHub. Figure out the link from the file path.
- Import instructions in the context is higlighted with **<instructions>**, ensure following them.

## Commit Rules

- when you commit the generated posts, also include the corresponding draft files.
- push to GitHub after committing.
